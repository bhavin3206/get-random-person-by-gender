# Get Random Person By Gender

This Python project generates random person images based on gender, utilizing the `thispersondoesnotexist` API. It's a simple, yet effective tool for generating images for various applications, such as testing, placeholders in UI designs, or any scenario where random user images are needed. Here I use opencv to guess gender of photos.
